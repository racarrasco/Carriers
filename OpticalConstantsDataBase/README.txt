The optical constants were taken from the WVASE database (hehe)
which are taken from literature, e.g. Aspnes, Palik's database etc.

InAs is from palik; a cutoff is performed because phonons show up in this
data set so when performing integration, we do a cutoff to just below the 
bandgap

InAsSb is from Webster (JAP,v118p245706y2015) IR-VASE ellipsometry results

InSb is currently from Aspnes ((PhysRevB,v27p985y1983))
    BUT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE BAND GAP GOES DOWN ONLY TO 1.5 eV (NEEDS TO 
    CHANGE) 

GaAs is from UNL, multiple optical constants fit (need reference) 
goes down to 0.1 eV to 6 eV
